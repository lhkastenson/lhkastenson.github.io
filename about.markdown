Lon is a software developer, sci-fi/fantasy book reader, and occasional music festival goer.

This blog is mostly for me to talk about interests, discuss various challenges I've met, and to sometimes just send some thoughts off into the void.

I'm currently working on nothing in particular and just enjoying life as it comes.

For any correspondence you can reach me at blog@lonkastenson.com I'll try to respond in a timely manner.
