Based on that definition alone, I think platitudes get a bad rap. Certainly they’re overused, you see them plastered on cafe walls, printed on souvenir t-shirts, and spoken at the end of `CURRENT_YEAR()` car ads. They’ve become stereotypes for marketing and banal comments you send someone just to be nice. But *some* stereotypes tend to exist for a reason.

I learned, I personally like some platitudes, maybe I’ll learn to like them all! But I have found there is that eureka moment where one of them just clicks.

In very broad strokes, here’s the story: 

After a major life change my mind was scattered. I was panicked and seeking a distraction to rationalize things. I felt like I was in a fight against an imperceptible monster and losing. I tried a guided meditation which soulessly reminded me, “meditation is a preventative exercise.” I actually had a little disdainful laugh after that.

I got support from friends and I don’t discredit anyone who reached out or to whom I reached out. Their support was definitely needed and recognized. Maybe too much recognition for some.

But there was a moment where one of those platitudes just fell into place. It was simple, but at that moment it felt thoughtful. It was exactly what I needed to hear. My mind distilled it out of all the rationalizing and metaphorical thoughts I was spiraling through. 

And maybe that’s the context the definition is missing: “a remark or statement…used too often to be interesting or thoughtful – **under normal circumstances**.”

I’m happy to report, *I’m happy*. Doing things feels good, as evidenced by this being my first blog post here. I’m grateful to my past self for actually setting up a little blog and renewing my domain.I have things planned and I think I will enjoy doing them.

I won’t share exactly which platitude helped me out, trust me, you’ve heard this one. But next time you’re browsing those greeting cards “don’t take yourself so seriously.”
